# Pinot Noir

Pinot noir is the colorscheme which is picked up from vim-256noir originally and
named after the pinot noir wine, which I happened to like recently.

This colorscheme is made using [colorbuddy](https://github.com/tjdevries/colorbuddy.nvim)

> I am aware that few things might look irregular and if you do find those irregularities,
> please raise a PR with correction, I'll look into it and merge.

## TODO

- [ ] Add screenshots of the scheme
